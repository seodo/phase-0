# Think about time

The time management and productivity ideas I learned about include meditation/mindfulness, the pomodoro technique, starting small, and time-boxing, all of which I will incorporate in the following weeks. Though these various ideas differ largely in technique, all provide a means of improving focus and productivity. For instance, time-boxing, similar to the pomodoro technique, is deciding on a set period of time during which one works towards a goal. It does not emphasize completing the work, but rather working within the time already set and evaluating the progress. It can be applied directly in Phase 0 as we will have five hours per day on average of work. By setting intervals (20-30 minutes) to do work, we can set aside time for breaks and for reflection. I believe in addition to time-boxing and the pomodoro technique, meditation and starting small will be necessary for me. I have a tendency to go straight into an assignment without a set amount of time, which often has the effect of burning out quickly and unable to do more. Going forward, I plan to utilize the pomodoro method by breaking up my work into 20-30 minute intervals and breaks. Additionally, I plan on starting my day with a bit of meditation, which in my experience gives a sense of clarity, calmness, and focus. I found the other articles on productivity "hacks" such as starting small really useful, and will be incorporating those as well.

## The command line

A shell is a program that takes user commands and gives them to the OS to carry out. Bash is an example of a shell program that runs on Linux and OS X. The most challenging part of this assignment was probably "View a file" section of the command line crash course. I had trouble copying the plain text file I created into the temp directory on the command and spent a long time playing around with it. In general, because working with the command line was completely new for me, I spent about 3-4 hours going through the crash course, but by the end of it I'd used all the commands at least once. The most important commands and arguments to know are "man", "apropos", "find", and "ls". Both the "man" and "apropos" commands are useful tools to learn about and find relevant information about different commands.  The "ls" command is also useful because it provides a list of the subgroups and folders within a directory and the "find" command helps to navigate and search for specific files. However, I think all the commands are important in the sense that they all have individual functions in the program.

pwd = print working directory

ls = list directory

mv = move file/directory

cd = change directory

../ = move up a directory

touch = create empty file

mkdir = make directory

less = page through a file

rmdir = remove directory

rm = remove file

help = displays help for commands
