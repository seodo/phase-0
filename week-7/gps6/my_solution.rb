# Takes information from another file and links it to the present file. The "require" method connects files via an absolute path, while "require_relative" links the files on a relative path.

# Reflection Section
=begin
What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
-The main hash, STATE_DATA, contains keys which are the states, and values, which are themselves
hashes of keys and values. The keys are the population density and population, which their values
are numbers equal to those keys.

What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
-Require relative connects this file to another file outside that file. It works somewhat
like the relative links we use in HTML to link outside files with the one we are working in.

What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
-We used the .each methods in this challenge to iterate through our STATE_DATA hash.

When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
- I noticed that the conditions were identical in the predicted_deaths method and the speed_of_Spread method.
We figured that this was not adherent to DRY rule, and combined the two methods.

What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
-I gained a better understanding of iterating through and working with nested structures like our STATE_DATA hash.
