What is a wireframe?
- A wireframe is essentially a layout of what a website will look like. 
What are the benefits of wireframing?
-Wireframing alows us to define the hierarchy of our web design. It faciliates planning and tailoring our website based on how we want our users to experience it.
Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
-It was the first time ever wireframing, but it felt familiar in theory--outlining our process and how to use the layout going forward.
Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
-For the most part I stuck with my first idea.
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
-The biggest question I had was in deciding the best way to put my ideas to practice. That is, how I could create a wireframe that best displayed what I intended. I browsed the web for various examples for inspiration.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
-The most tedious part would have been making the actual wireframe and the specific dimensions of each 'box'. The entire challenge was pretty straightforward otherwise.
