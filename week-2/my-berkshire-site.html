<!--
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
-Applying the skills I learned into an actual site was fun. I got practice step by step what building a website is like and how it all comes together.
How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
-Because it was one of my first times writing HTML, it took some time going back and forth the videos/resources to make sure I was doing things the right way.
How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e no formatting in the HTML)
- I mainly used the Introduction to HTML video as a reference which helped me set up the outline of the HTML page.
What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is relatively simple to execute, but its simplicity is what presents some issues. For example, HTML is more about the structure and text of a webpage and not so much the design or asthetic aspect of making a webpage.
What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
-I don't really have tricks per se, but I do remember that every HTMl page should begin with the doctype; I also know that each closing tag should have a "/".
